# Server-Sent Events #

Server-Sent Events can be used by web applications or web sites to setup a uni-directional (one-way)
communication channel over a single TCP connection. <br><br>You can use it for push notifications from a server<br>
to a browser client. Server-Sent Events sometimes provide an alternative to usages of Ajax, HTTP Long<br>
Polling or Comet. <br><br>In the browser you can use Server-Sent Events via the <i>EventSource API</i>. This API belongs<br>
to HTML5 and is standardized by the W3C: <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource/'>http://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource/</a>
<br>

ZAP is able to:<br>
<ul><li>intercept and show Server-Sent Events</li></ul>

Server-Sent Events are displayed within the <a href='HelpAddonsSseTab.md'>Server-Sent Events tab</a>.
