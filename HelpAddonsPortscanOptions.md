# Options Port Scan screen #

This screen allows you to configure the port scan options:
### Maximum port to scan ###
ZAP will start from 1 and work up to this port number. <br>Selecting a high number will significantly increase<br>
the time a port scan takes.<br>
<h3>Concurrent scanning threads per host</h3>
The number of threads the scanner will use per host. <br>Increasing the number of threads will speed up the<br>
scan but may put extra strain on the computer ZAP is running on and the target host.
